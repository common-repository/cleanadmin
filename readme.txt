== Description ==

The Wordpress Admin Design isn't really nice and it's stressing! This theme clean up all admin design and makes your posts more relaxed.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Navigate in Wordpress Admin Pages and see the new, clean design!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the plugin change Wordpress layout? =

No, it changes only the CSS Style, so you'll have all functionalities you have without the plugin.

= Is the plugin compatible with all WP versions? =

No, because Wordpress could change after each update the admin style, and the plugin is based on it. So if you want to be sure to see the correct style of CleanAdmin you need last Wordpress version.
